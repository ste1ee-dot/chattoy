So the idea of how this would work is:
A user creates a server and to invite someone (everyone has to be invited separately, since this app is not supposed to be used for communities but rather for private temponary chats between a few people), click a button which will generate a new url
which he sends to the user that is to be invited. When the user goes to the url he'll be asked to enter a username for that chat. Once he does, the url will get bound to that username. In order for him to access the chat, he'll have to use that url.
When you kick someone from the server, the only way for them to get in again, is that the host user, invites them again with a newly generated url. The same url cannot be generated multiple times.
